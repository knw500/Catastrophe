The following changes have been made to the original project:
- Fixed naming of 'image' imageView that creates a build error.
- Fixed naming of Interface Builder file that is different to reference name.
- Fixed various UI updates on the background thread that leads to runtime errors in multiple places. Switched to DispatchQueue.main.async.
- If statement replaced with guard in service image retrieval method, fixing logic flow.
- ShowInformationViewController 'updateShowImage' method linked with DataSource method.
- ImageView now unhides after image is loaded.
- Autolayout constraints have been updated in a workaround.
- Label displaying errors is repositioned.
- Correction of code computing number of days since launch.
- Fixed DataSource computed 'showName' property which was computing the ID

ToDo list:
- The format of the JSON retrieved from the source appears to be of the wrong format for the 'Show' model. The default Show for Breaking Bad is always loaded.
- The same error appears regardless of the cause. A better description of errors would be helpful to a user.
- Layout may not scale appropriately across all devices. 
- Date formatter gives a negative value for the number of days since the launch of a show. Further investigation is needed to assess why this is the case.
- An indication that the app is loading data would be nice, especially due to potentially long wait times for downloading images.
